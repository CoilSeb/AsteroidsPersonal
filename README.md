An asteroids based rougelike game that I have been working on. I have made this repository public for the purposes of showing companies and anyone interested in me my progress. With that said, I can't stop anyone from forking this repository, just know that this is still very much a work in progress with big breaks in progress because of work and school and being my first ever major project in Godot.
